# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns
Udacity Deep Learning ND Project on Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns

In this project, a simple Nueral Network is built to predict bike rental patterns in a specific period.

The network is a simple MLP and the goal is to implement all of the following parts from scratch:
 - model architecture
 - forward pass
 - backward propagation
 - weight updates
 
The performance of the model is checked versus existing data to evaluate accuracy.

This is a very useful excercise to train with different learning rates, batch sizes, node numbers, etc to find efficent selections.
